			<p> <h2> The European Commission: an overview </h2>
			The European Commission is the executive body of the European Union. The body is responsible 
			for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the Union's treaties and the general
			day-to-day running of the Union. The Commission operates as a cabinet government, with 27 members 
			of the Commission (informally known as "commissioners"). There is one member per member state, 
			though members are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home 
			state. One of the 27 is the Commission President proposed 
			by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament. The Council then appoints the 
			other 26 members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President, and then the 27 
			members as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament. The first 
			Barroso Commission took office in late 2004 and its successor, under the same President, took 
			office in 2010. <br/>
			The term "Commission" is used either in the narrow sense of the 27-member College of 
			Commissioners (or College) or to also include the administrative body of about 23,000 European 
			civil servants who are split into departments called Directorates-General and Services.
			The internal working languages of the Commission are English, French and German.
			The Members of the Commission and their "cabinets" (immediate teams) are based in the 
			Berlaymont building of Brussels.</p>
			
			<p> <h2> CORDIS </h2>
			The european commission is currently supporting another long running funding program: CORDIS, 
			the Community Research and Development Information Service, is an interactive information portal 
			available <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu">here</a> to support European research and innovation 
			cooperation. Advisory services on conducting research using CORDIS is available at European 
			Documentation Centres across the European Union. <br/>

			CORDIS's principal aims are:
			facilitate participation in the activities of European research, in particular FP7 (the Seventh Framework Programme)
			publish the results of projects funded by the EU
			promote the dissemination of knowledge in order to reinforce the innovation capacity of enterprises
			contribute to bridge the gap between citizens and science. <br/>
			
			CORDIS offers access to a broad range of information and services on EU research, including:
			The primary repository of EU-funded research projects and their results since 1990, including the formal deliverables collected by the European Commission
			Daily news, events, funding opportunities and research showcases, provided by both the European Commission and by user contributions
			An interactive environment to find research partners and to support discussion forums
			Many thematic services, national contact points, a library of documents, user guidance and a range of search facilities, including custom email alerts and RSS feeds
			Further databases and services to support EU research activities
			The CORDIS website is available in six languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Polish), although much of the scientific content is only in English.
